# FreeFoodFinder
CSE110 project to find free food around you. 


#### BUGs/TODOs

* WARNING MESSAGES:
  * enable Wi-Fi
  * enable GPS
* TAG FILTERING (SEARCHING)
 * str1.toLowerCase().contains(str2.toLowerCase()) or something
 * can split a search tag string based on spaces for searching (better to have extra results than no results)
* VIEWS
 * Small map event view shouldn't contain "foods" unless we know if users know to add kinds of food to a certain field (maybe replace it with "tags" or "description")
 * Detailed/Large event view almost done
* MAPS API 
 * MapTabs -> auto-fill location (with best guess) almost done
 * ListTabs -> place marker based on choosen location (need to talk to Alex about this)
